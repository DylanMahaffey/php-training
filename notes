--happy bean design


    didn't know what we were selling at first
    unlimited stood out
    kind of confident in our abilities
        need more work displayed
    can't see big differences in plans
        emphisize the pro plan
    good idea?
        1. can't tell
    easy navigation
    social medias need work!

    the word design should pop out more
    call to action above the fold
    we need to stand out
    call it pricing on the navigation
    emphisize the line of communication
    abandonment fear (show the process after purchase)
    straight forward design (navigations names need changing(features to pricing * ))
    build confidence
    possible video on the landing page
    emphisize the best design work we have to build confidence
    maybe make a funny ad

    





    -----Definite changes
    scale back pain points
    change the chart to checks and Xs rather than yes's and no's
    emphisize price differences
    make an actual nav bar
    make a prices page
    let them know what happens next
